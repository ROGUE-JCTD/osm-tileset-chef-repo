Overview

This repository creates a generic mapnik tile server with apache2.

The repo builds the mapnic server but it does not import data into the 
PostGIS database.  Download data from geofabrique or generate / extract 
a dataset and import into the PostGIS database.

To import data, use the su command or su to the osmdata user and run the following command:

osm2pgsql --create --slim -C 1500 --number-processes 1 -S /home/osmdata/src/openstreetmap-carto/openstreetmap-carto.style --hstore --multi-geometry <Path to Dataset>


To do:

 - Remove unnecessary user accounts.  Initially followed an openstreetmap guideline that:
	a - didn't work
	b - was more complex than required

- Clean up test code.  This repo was originally based using the rouge-chef-repo and a lot
or the code is unnecessary here.

- Remove unnecessary packages.  Some of these are leftovers from migrating from mapnic on 
an Ubuntu 12.04 to the 14.04 OS.
