Overview

This repository creates a generic mapnik tile server with apache2 and PostGIS.

The repo configures a mapnik server but it does not import data into the PostGIS database.

The easiest way to get a dataset is to download a dataset from geofabrique at download.geofabrik.de.  

Using chrome search download.geofabrik.de and find a dataset you want, right click over the [osm.pbf] 
or [osm.bz2] and select copy link address.  This will put the link path into the clipboard.

Next, access the mapnik VM as the vagrant user.  In the Vm commad line enter:

vagrant ssh

Once you are the vagrant user, become the osmdata user.  At the commad line enter:

sudo su - osmdata

As the osmdata user cd to the /tmp directory.

cd /tmp

Download the geofabrique file to this location.  You would enter command wget and then right click the mouse \
and select paste to enter the datafile selected earlier.  The command would look like the following:

wget http://download.geofabrik.de/central-america/belize-latest.osm.pbf

Select enter and the file will download.

To import the file into the database run the following command as the osmdata user.

/opt/osm-tileset-chef-repo/scripts/install_datafile.sh

This script is intended to be a quick / flexible way to import the osm data, in either pbf or bz2 formats, into the 
database but it will attempt to import all pbf and bz2 datafiles found in the /tmp directoty.  Having more than one 
pbf or bz2 file could cause the import to fail under certain circumstances.  Additional warning. Any data in the 
database will be deleted as part of this import.

Recently completed:

 - Removed unneseccary mapnik user accounts.  These were created following an openstreetmap wiki guideline 
   but are unnecessary.
 - Replaced package apache2-threaded-dec with apache2-dev.
 - Replaced ruby-2.0.0-p353 with ruby-2.0.0-p645.  This got rid of the security warnings.
 - Cleaned up test code.
 - Created osm data file import script.
 - replaced genericpostgresql database packages with more secure versions.
 - Updated the README file to be easier for users to do osm data file imports.

Still to do:

- Review Berksfile and Gemfile.  Build lock files.
- Review code for any leftover test code.
