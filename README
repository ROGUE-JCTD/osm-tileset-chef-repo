Overview

This repository creates a generic mapnik tile server with apache2 and PostGIS.

The repo configures a mapnic server but it does not import data into the 
PostGIS database.  Download a dataset from geofabrique or generate / extract 
a dataset from something like OSM and import into the PostGIS database.

To import data, use the su command or su to the osmdata user and run the following command:

osm2pgsql --create --slim -C 1500 --number-processes 1 -S /home/osmdata/src/openstreetmap-carto/openstreetmap-carto.style --hstore --multi-geometry <Path to Dataset>

Recently completed:

 - Removed unneseccary mapnik user accounts.  These were created following an openstreetmap wiki guideline but are unnecessary.
 - Replaced package apache2-threaded-dec with apache2-dev
 - Replaced ruby-2.0.0-p353 with ruby-2.0.0-p645.  This got rid of the security warnings.
 - Cleaned up test code.

Still to do:

- Review packages and remove unnecessary packages.  Some of these are leftover from migrating mapnic on 
an Ubuntu 12.04 instance to the 14.04 OS and following inaccurate openstreetmap wiki guidelines on creating 
a mapnik server.
- Build an automated cache builder for the imported dataset.
